# Security and Support Policies

## Supported Versions
Starting from January 2022 onwards, support for new and old releases has been reduced.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event you discover a security vulnerability, please email ``contact@aluminiumte.ch`` with the Subject of ``PlatformKit Vulnerability``.

Upon receving the email we will make a reasonable attempt to respond within 3 days although this may not always be possible. Firstly we will send an email back confirming receipt of the security vulnerability disclosure email.
Once we have evaluated the nature of the security vulnerability we will email you with an update on the situation.

At this point if the vulnerability is accepted we will attempt to find a solution to fix the vulnerability. 

Once a fix has been developed we will then ask you to re-test the security vulnerability against the new patched version.

If the patched version elminates the vulnerability then we will release the new patched version immediately and some time thereafter announce the security update's existance and how to be protected against the vulnerability.

As a general policy we will try to put security vulnerability fixes in new build or patch versions as opposed to new major or minor versions.
If a new update is in the works and we discover the vulnerability we will patch it in the existing version first and then apply the patch to the in progress version we are working on.

If we reject the vulnerability, we will email you telling you so and discuss possible ways to move forward.
