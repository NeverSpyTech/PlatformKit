# PlatformKit (formerly AluminiumCoreLib)

### formerly AluminiumCoreLib

AluminiumCoreLib was designed to help programmers be more efficient when using C# by providing a library containing many things that programmers may need in their application.

## About PlatformKit

PlatformKit is a re-focussing on making the library, written in C#, more lightweight and focussing specifically on dealing with Platform specific code, platform specific issues, and platform detection.

This is a Work In Progress and so some things may not work well or may not work at all.

This can be added to any .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Core 3.1, or .NET 5 supported Application.
