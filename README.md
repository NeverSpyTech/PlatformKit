## About AluminiumCoreLib.hardware
AluminiumCoreLib.Hardware is a complementary library which is it's own project and can be found [here](https://github.com/AluminiumTech/AluminiumCoreLib.Hardware) .

AluminiumCoreLib.Hardware deals with the complexity of getting Hardware Information. It used to be part of AluminiumCoreLib but was seperated due to requiring .NET Framework 4.x for the C# version.

As such, AluminiumCoreLib.Hardware can only be used in .NET Framework projects.
